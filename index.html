        <p>Many peole think that singing is just a hobby, but realy it is a sport. You train your vocal cords to reach notes high and low and there are many kinds of pitch ranges the certain people can reach. I am a soprano the highest range but at the same time i will have puberty witch will make my voice go lower into a tenor but i will try to keep my voice at a sopranno by practesing.</p>
